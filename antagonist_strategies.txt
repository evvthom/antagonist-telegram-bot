Ask what survives if this fails  
Name the thing you’re pretending not to see  
Break one promise gently  
Reverse the last decision you made  
Erase the most obvious option  
Imagine the wrong person is in charge  
Keep going until it gets weird  
Make the silence longer  
Ask what is rotting here  
Use the bad idea, just once  
Replace fear with boredom  
Invite collapse, then watch closely  
Let it decay in public  
Cut the thing that makes it feel safe  
Refuse to finish  
Stop protecting the beautiful part   
Apply weight where there is none  
Expose what was hidden first  
Ask where the body is buried  
Stop optimizing
Swap your opinion with its opposite  
Ignore the deadline deliberately  
Break the sequence
Make it worse on purpose  
Take the last step backward  
Pull one thread until the whole thing unravels  
Allow something to remain broken  
Make a case for something staying ugly  
Imagine it is already ruined  
Treat the mistake as sacred  
Choose the path that exhausts you  
Cut the part that took the longest
Give someone with bad opinions a say
Delay the reaction as long as possible  
Take away the easy exit  
Replace one truth with a better lie  
Do the dangerous version  
Throw out the clever part  
Add friction where it was smooth  
Make it impossible to ignore  
Trust the glitch  
Fold it until it disappears  
Act as though the end is near  
Say it too soon  
Refuse to clean it up  
Kill the darling, keep the corpse  
Swap left with right  
What if you stopped now  
Make the rule stranger  
Let something go feral  
Sit with the unpleasant answer  
Do nothing until it hurts  
Strip it back until you’re scared  
Make one thing too heavy to ignore
Make peace with the elephant in the room
Leave one edge unfinished  
Split it in two and keep only one half  
Refuse to be efficient  
Invite the wrong crowd  
Make it more fragile  
Reveal the pattern then destroy it  
Ask if it should have existed at all  
Repeat until it breaks  
Bury the safest part  
Trade beauty for strength  
Break continuity
Say the opposite of what you mean once  
Stretch the silence to breaking  
Let it stay uncomfortable  
Choose the second solution  
Forget one step deliberately   
Make the constraint absurd    
Give it a deadline that cannot be met  
Act before you are ready  
Split it into pieces and scatter 
Hand it to someone reckless  
Discard the version that works  
Name it something untrue  
Make the shadow louder than the subject  
Invent a ritual that feels dangerous  
Add something that doesn’t belong  
Cut out the meaning  
Hand control to chance  
Do the worst possible version, beautifully  
Look for what resists the most change  
Force yourself to keep the first draft  
Leave a crack on purpose  
Push it beyond repair  
Give it one last chance to speak  
Kill the symmetry  
Make the quietest part the loudest  
Double down on the wrong choice  
Push the timeline past breaking  
Reveal what was supposed to stay hidden  
Ask what happens if you do nothing  
Turn presence into absence
Make the failure instructive  
Keep the thing that doesn’t fit  
Say it in the cruelest way possible  
Replace precision with excess  
Give it a new enemy  
Make it so slow it becomes unbearable  
Choose the unstable solution  
Demand too much, once  
Stop just before the finish line  
Let it feel haunted  
Hold the tension without resolving it  
Test the patience of everyone involved
Invite a saboteur and listen to them
Make the outcome irreversible
Share it with someone who will hate it
Sharpen what was blurred
Reverse the order of trust
Refuse to explain
Commit to the worst idea
Create something that invites mockery
Strip away the metaphor, show the wound
Make it illegal to be neutral
Turn the weakness into the centerpiece
Give power to the least qualified
Keep what you were meant to discard
Make it dependent on chance
Replace order with disorder deliberately
Don’t fix the crack, widen it
Demand an answer that doesn’t exist
